We did not design errorValue class at first, and then we had to use "try catch" when to convert a
cell that contains invalid input to an errorValue class. We think that's a poor design and may cause
some bugs in some situation. What's more, we designed a ButtonListener class which could add action
listener to our editor view in the controller. After looking at our provider's code, we realize that
it is a better design to encapsulate ButtonListener in our editor view, and that would make our code 
more flexible, so we update this for our customers. Moreover, the code from provider is quite clean, 
and we thought we could do better to break down those methods and remove some unnecessary codes. 
It is a great experience with our providers. The end of semester, good luck to all!
