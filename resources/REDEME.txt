The provider's code encapsulated the action listener and implements mouse listener directly,
which is convenient for us to reuse their code. We were able get all the features working.
They have many methods that get and return concrete classes in model, we have to create all the missing
class to make it work. For example, they have an interface named feature, which only has one method
modifyCell that modify a given Coord with the given String. We make our new controller implements
feature and we could use their editor view by create a model adaptor class finally.
