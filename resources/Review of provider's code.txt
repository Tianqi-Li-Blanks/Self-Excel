In general, the code from provider is flexible and reusable. They encapsulated features in their editor view so that we can use it easily. 
The code is written cleanly and well-documented which saves us a lot of time to figure out the purpose of each class as well as method. 
Also, their code is well constructed and does not have redundant method, and their views could reach almost all the requirements.
However, they could still make some improvements to make their code more flexible. In their model class, they have methods
that get and return concrete classes, which make the code a little bit inflexible. We had to create the missing class to make it work.
It is a better design not get or return concrete class in model. What's more, their view has a concrete model
class, instead of it, it is better to contain a interface of model.
Overall, their code is great, and we learn a lot from it. It was a nice experience to work their code. Their code is convenient to reuse, 
and we did not spend to much time on it. Good job!
